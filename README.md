# Machine-Learning-Models
Archive of python notebooks I made for my machine learning class
I used google colaboratory to run the code (my pc's gpu did NOT wanna cooperate lol) 
this was a very fun project; hopefully ill be able to apply this to other projects in the future
still wanna try figuring out a way to train a model on audio frequencies for choir...
